# BadCat Motion Sensor 

This Device uses a Photon, a PIR motion sensor & peizo buzzer from SparkFun
Kit to determine whether a cat has been detected on a surface such as a table
or counter and publishes events to IFFF to send SMS texts & notifications.

The code was created from a particle conference room motion detector tutorial & SPARKFUN SIK
Guide buzzer example. 

Flashed to the photon using the particle IDE https://www.particle.io/
